Experience
Enterprise Technology at Arizona State University
September 2024 - June 2025
AI Data Science Student Worker
Python, Pytorch, Transformers, Streamlit, Langchain, Ollama, OpenAI API, Neo4j, Git
• Designed a Natural Language Query tool that allows users to filter, extract, and visualize data from multi-table databases with
query execution accuracy above 90% utilizing conversational inputs.
• Optimized text-to-SQL speed using advanced prompt engineering, fine-tuned LLMs, and GraphRAG, resulting in a 15% increase
in query execution efficiency over baseline models.
• Integrated LangChain for fast orchestration and Neo4j as a vector database for efficient semantic search, deployed on AWS EKS
for scalable inference, and reduced response time by 30% over 100+ questions each session.
Telus International AI CV
July 2023 - July 2024
Machine Learning Engineer 1
Python, Pytorch, Transformers, NLP, Open3D, Git, Docker, AWS, Linux
• Fine-tuned open-source LLMs on math and scientific topics using PEFT-based methods in a RAG pipeline, increasing manual
question development throughput by 50% and reducing content generation time by 40%.
• Tested the fine-tuned LLM against standard NLP benchmarks (MATH, MMLU etc.) and internal domain-specific datasets, yield-
ing a +6% improvement in benchmark scores.
• Evaluated the fine-tuned 3D object detection and tracking models (Voxel-based and DeepSORT) on the KITTI benchmark,
achieving around 90% precision for object detection and 70% MOTA (Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy) for tracking.
Telus International AI CV
July 2022 - July 2023
Machine Learning Engineer Intern
Python, Pytorch, Sklearn, Open3D, Git, Docker, Linux
• Prototyped a method for tracking identified bounding boxes over video sequences using DeepSORT and ByteTrack, which was
tested on the MOT17 benchmark and achieved around 80% mAP for object identification and 75% IDF1 for multi-object tracking.
• Built an automated data extraction pipeline from AWS S3 and SQL databases, resulting in a structured ML dataset library that
increased model validation and testing efficiency by 50%.
• Worked with the team to create and evaluate object detection strategies for 3D point clouds using Open3D. Deterministic ap-
proaches proved to be 15% more accurate and simpler to use than point pillar-based approaches.
